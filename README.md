# Land Affairs Helper by Nuxt.js v2

This project needs to work with my another project, [Land-Affairs-Helper](https://github.com/pyliu/Land-Affairs-Helper), that serves as PHP API server to provide json data used by this frontend project.
> Please refers to .env.example file to setup the require variables to start the nuxt.js server.
